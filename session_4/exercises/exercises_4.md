# Session 4 Exercises
## Section A
1. Write a function that prints your name
2. Write a function that accepts a name as a parameter and prints "Hello, <name>"
3. Loop through the list ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"] and call the function you just wrote
4. Write a function that prints the area of two passed in parameters
5. Write a function called 'print_list' that accepts a list as a parameter and then prints out each item of the list
6. Put the following into a function:
    1. If they are younger than 11, print "You're too young to go to this school"
    2. If they are between 11 and 16, print "You can can come to this school"
    3. If they are over 16, print 'You're too old for school"
    4. If they are 0, print "You're not born yet!"

## Section B
1. Write a function called is_odd that will return True or False if the integer passed as a parameter is odd (hint: x % 2 will return true for all odd numbers)
2. Write a function that accepts a word and returns it backwards, e.g. 'hello' -> 'olleh'
3. Write a recursive function that accepts a number and prints that number of stars, followed by ever decreasing stars on each line, E.g:
*****
****
***
**
*
4. Create a padlock function. You need to be able to pass in a passcode and if its correct it should return "Unlock", else "Locked"
5. Write a function that returns the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 between 0 and limit (parameter). For example, if limit is 20, it should return the sum of 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20
6. Write a function called is_prime() that accepts a number and return True or False if the number of prime or not

## Section C
1. Read the file 'jabberwocky.txt' and print its content to the screen
2. Ask the user to enter their name and append this to a file called 'register.txt'
3. Each line of the file 'numbers.txt' contains a number, write a script to add up all the values in the file
4. Create a new file called 'even.txt' that contains only the even numbers from the file 'numbers.txt'
5. 'secret.txt' contains a secret message. Each number represents the letter of the alphabet where 1 = A, 2 = B ... Z = 26. Work out what the secret message says
6. Benfordâ€™s law states that the leading digits in a collection of data are probably going to be small. For example, most numbers in a set (about 30%) will have a leading digit of 1, when the expected probability is 11.1% (i.e. one out of nine digits). Fake data is usually evenly distributed, where as real data The files 'accounts_1.txt', 'accounts_2.txt' and 'accounts_3.txt' contain financial transaction data. Work out which of the files contains fake data.
